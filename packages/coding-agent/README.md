## Rewind viewport

With an empty editor, press Escape twice to open rewind at the recent tail. Up/Down choose rendered turns; Left/Right move between sibling branches at a fork or between user turns otherwise. Enter rewinds to the outlined source entry; Escape cancels. Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, and the mouse wheel inspect history without changing the selected rewind destination.

Rewind uses journal-entry anchors rather than guessed global row numbers. Edge arrows indicate more history; cold history remains accessible without pre-rendering it. The first open indexes source descriptors cooperatively with a cancellable loading view. Only demanded transcript components are instantiated, and offscreen components are released. Reopening unchanged history reuses the source index and bounded last-visible window; source rewrites, branch changes, and relevant presentation changes invalidate that view. A single large message or grouped tool card still costs the work required by its own renderer.

## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.omp/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker), retains transcripts every Nth user turn, recalls memories on the first turn of a session, and exposes `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session immediately replaces the live backend, memory tools, listeners, and system-prompt context. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch; afterward, `memory.backend` is the sole runtime selector.
